                So a little paragraph about me, I am actually a timed served machinist, I made various components from scratch using manual machines. I was then introduced to CNC 
                (Computer Numerical Control) machines and progressed my career in engineering further, but as the engineering market is very uncertain at times, so I created The
                Green Van Man for more stability.
