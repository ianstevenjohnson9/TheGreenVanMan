            <p class="paras">So the first initially enquiry is done over the phone and that normally regards availability, so when phoning its best to have these details</p>

                </ul>
            <p class="paras">Once I have this information I will either be available or not. If I am available I will require all the above information in a text message to properly confirm and 
                book you in.

            <h2 class="headingTwo">Bookings</h2>
            <p class="paras">Once I send you a price, please don't forget to confirm. also a message like "Please book me in for then" as "ok" have left customers thinking they have booked when "ok"
                is not a confirming answer.
